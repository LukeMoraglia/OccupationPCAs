# OccupationPCAs
This is the public repository for data, codes, and analysis of the O*NET paper.

We also provide a ShinyApp (by Luke E. Moraglia; https://lukemoraglia.shinyapps.io/ONETrowClust/) for researchers to generate clusters from O*NET themselves. In this ShinyApp, you can choose between clustering methods (hierarchical clustering or k-means), number of occupation clusters, and number of occupational trait clusters) to extract results. The App will illustrates the figures and you can download .csv files of the clustering results.
