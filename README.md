# OccupationPCAs
This is the public repository for data, codes, and analysis of the O*NET paper.

We also provide a ShinyApp (by Luke E. Moraglia; https://rb.gy/weabtf) for researchers to generate occupation clusters from O*NET themselves. In this ShinyApp, we showed the PCA results from our paper with different color schemes. In the SandBox tab, you can choose the Job Zones to include and the number of occupation clusters. The App will generate the PCA figures (the first two components) and you can download .csv files of the clustering results.

*Note: The analyzed data matrix has occupation on the rows and occupational traits on the columns; therefore, the row clusters (which we used to name the ShinyApp) indicate clusters of the occupations.*
